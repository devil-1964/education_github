# Education Github Clone Website

Welcome to the Education Github Clone Website project! 

**Project Inspiration**: We are inspired by the design and features of [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/students).

## Note:
This website is not responsive. I made this while learning Tailwind CSS, when I came near the end, I noticed it was not responsive; at that time, I was too late. In the future, if I have time, I will definitely make it responsive. Otherwise, it is a fully working site very similar to the original.

## Plot

I made most of the website using *Tailwind CSS* but I used some *Javascript* for the Dropdown Menu.

**Dropdown Explained**: I toggled the *invisible* class using the *onClick* function on the Dropdown Button which display: none to the Dropdown content. I also added window.onclick function to make Dropdown menu invisible when click on any part of the page when Dropdown is set to block.
